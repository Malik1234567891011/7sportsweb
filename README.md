# 7Sports Website Rebuild

This project is a **next-level website redesign** for my boss’s company, [7Sports](https://www.7sports.info).  
The goal is to transform the existing site into a **premium, cinematic, and highly functional experience** that reflects the brand’s energy and professionalism.

## 🚀 Vision
- **Premium & Professional**: Trustworthy for parents, inspiring for kids.  
- **Cinematic Experience**: Full-bleed video hero, smooth scroll, and subtle motion.  
- **Red Branding**: Red is central to the visual identity, paired with navy, white, and modern accents.  
- **Story-Driven Layout**: Hero → Programs → Why 7Sports → Regions → Testimonials → Call-to-Action.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Next.js 15** (App Router, Turbopack)  
- **TypeScript** for type safety  
- **CSS Modules** with design tokens (red/navy/white brand system)  
- **Radix UI** primitives for accessible components  
- **Motion + Lenis** for smooth animations and cinematic polish  
- **Lucide React** icons  

## 📂 Planned Sections
1. **Hero** — Full-screen video background, headline, and booking CTA  
2. **Programs** — Cards for Soccer, Multisport, Dek Hockey  
3. **Why 7Sports?** — Key selling points with icons  
4. **Regions** — Montréal, Montérégie, Estrie, Outaouais tiles  
5. **Testimonials** — Parent quotes in carousel/cards  
6. **Call-to-Action Footer** — Bold red panel with easy booking  

## 📌 Status
Currently setting up the design system, hero section, and core components.  
Final site will be **responsive, fast, and visually striking**, built for both **parents’ trust** and **kids’ excitement**.

✨ Built with care to showcase **7Sports** as the leader in non-competitive sports programs for kids in Québec.
